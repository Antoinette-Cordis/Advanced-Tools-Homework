            Health Benefits of Eating Yoghurt Are: Improves Digestion: Consuming
            yoghurt every day, keeps our bowel movements regular and improves
            our body's flora. It kills the harmful bacteria in the gut and makes
            our digestive system healthier. Yoghurt is also found to be
            effective in lactose intolerance, constipation, inflammatory bowel
            disease and infections caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria.
            Natural Immunity Booster: Regular consumption of yoghurt enhances
            our immune system and protects our body from a variety of
            infections. [3]Yoghurt effectively fights against gastrointestinal
            infections, respiratory issues like common cold, flu and even
            cancer.

            Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available
            goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the
            potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A
            typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which
            identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers, that is,
            those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity. Online
            shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry as
            consumers can now search for product information and place product
            orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their
            products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever they
            want. The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for
            consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and
            to have it delivered relatively quickly. Using online shopping
            methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically
            visiting physical stores. This way they save time and the cost of
            traveling. A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a
            selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for
            money or other goods. Shoppers' shopping experiences may vary. They
            are based on a variety of factors including how the customer is
            treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.
